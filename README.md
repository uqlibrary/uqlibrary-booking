#uqlibrary-booking 

This repo used to provided a responsive front end to the [old Facilities Booking System (FBS)](https://www.library.uq.edu.au/fbs/ctrlpnl.php) as part of the [MyLibrary Application](https://github.com/uqlibrary/uqlibrary-mylibrary/). 
FBS has been replaced by [Book It](https://uqbookit.uq.edu.au/) so this repo is [no longer required](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/148116771) and all calls to it have been replaced with links to Book It.
